# book_ban_project

Project Idea
Book bans are becoming more prevalent across the United States. There are some obvious themes that are being targeted more than others. I would say
the top two that I have seen are books with some form of LGBT or elements of non-white culture. I originally wanted to look at the authors themselves
and what types of authors were being challenged. As I started working on this I realized that would be a lot of work and I’m not sure if I could get
all the information I wanted on an Author where it would be meaningful.

I changed my direction to look at the books themselves and what I could find out about them. I came up with the idea of using the tags on a book that
were generated by readers. This way I could look at the contents of the books that were being challenged.

Data and Data Cleaning
I found a data set for banned books and used the data on the challenges from 21-22 and 22-23. For data cleaning on this data set I used Excel to do
most of the cleaning in the form of making sure that book titles and author’s names were spelled correctly and just all the information was filled in
generally. For the non-challenged books I built off from a dataset I found on Kaggle.

To find out the contents of each book I looked to the popular book social media site Goodreads. Readers tag and organize the books they read into
certain categories. If enough readers tag the book they can be seen on the books page. Her is an example for the book Gender Queer :

I added these top tags to a column in the dataset. This is where I created my independent variables.

Model Building
As I was working on cleaning the dataset I realized that it would be hard to find/create a dataset of non challenged books. This data set had children, young adult, and adult books. There were also fiction and nonfiction. The nonfiction books also came from a variety of topics of biographies, sex education, and teaching philosophies. I knew I had to narrow it down so I looked at only young adult books. 

I used logistical modeling for this data set because essentially I am looking at whether or not a book has these tags. The book has LGBT content and then looking at if the book had been challenged or not. There are only categorical variables in my data set. 

I had two different ideas when it came to model building. The first one was to make dummy variables for the top tags I found with the challenged books and playing around with those. From this I created the model:

Looking at the different coefficients this means if two books are similar:
a book with an LGBT tag is 168.66 times likely to be challenged than not
a book with a Realistic Fiction tag is 6.71 times more likely to be challenged than not
a book with a Middle Grade tag is 0.29 times more likely to to be challenged than not
a book with a Graphic Novels tag is 21.57 times more likely to be challenged than not

The other method I tried was trying to use the domain knowledge I had from following the story in the media and trying to put myself in the shoes of someone challenging books and what tags I would challenge. This started out as a model with 33 independent variables. This idea was mostly for fun and I mostly relied on my gut feelings when picking these tags. Unsurprisingly, even when I eliminated the not statistically significant variables this model was worse than my previous model, so I stuck with that one
Challenges
The dataset took a lot longer than I thought it would to clean, and I wasn’t able to clean up all the columns to the level I would have liked. This also meant that I had less time to make the data set of the unchallenged books. I believe that if I had a larger data set the result might have been drastically different. When creating a dataset of non challenged books I had more challenges. I think it would be incredibly difficult to even make a dataset of unchallenged books that contained unchallenged counterparts to each of the different types of books on the challenged list. There aren’t a lot of datasets to start out with, and most of them are about adult fiction books.

Even when I narrowed my focus to just young adult books I had some difficulty. I wanted to avoid picking books that were unlikely to be challenged ever. This means I wanted to pick popular books and somewhat newer books. These got hard to find. I also had the question about independence. Early on I decided that two books by the same author could be considered independent because the challenged data set had books like that. I am still wrestling with the idea of two books in the same series being considered independent because they will often have very similar tags.

Finally I don’t know if this is a challenge or not, but I wanted to mention it. I am hesitant to say that Graphic Novels are statistically significant when determining if a book will be challenged. When I was making my unchallenged dataset most of the books were older, and I feel that the popularity of Graphic Novels is a new thing. Basically I don’t think my unchallenged featured enough graphic novels and it is something I want to look into more.
