FINAL DECISION: Jan 23: Library will keep but it will remain in the library in the adult section. Complaintant plans to appeal

The person who filed the complaint is pretty clear on her agenda: “Aside from “Sex is a Funny Word,” Murray and her daughter also decried the presence of four LGBTQ+-themed books in the library, although she did not file a complaint seeking the removal of those books. In subsequent interviews, Murray said she and others have discovered a total of 86 LGBTQ+-themed books in the library that she does not believe should be available.”",Unknown,,,Public,December,2022,Nebraska,,,,,Keene Memorial Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Board member Julia Routbort Baskin said the book can speak to many students, including anyone who has been uncomfortable with their body.

“While I understand and appreciate the concerns about the explicit sexual content that is in some pages of the book, to cherry pick that out of the many pages of the book I think does the book a disservice and I think our high school students are more than mature enough to handle this kind of content,” she said.",Retained,,,School ,April,2023,New York,Ballston Spa Central School District,,,,,,On Shelves,4/22/23,https://dailygazette.com/2023/04/21/gender-queer-book-to-stay-in-ballston-spa-high-school-library/,https://dailygazette.com/2023/04/18/ballston-spa-school-board-expected-to-vote-to-keep-lgbtq-themed-book/,https://dailygazette.com/2023/04/21/gender-queer-book-to-stay-in-ballston-spa-high-school-library/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
